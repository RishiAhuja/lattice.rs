# lattice.rs

A collection of fundamental data structures implemented from scratch in Rust for learning and reference.

## Overview

**lattice.rs** is a hands-on exploration of classic data structures using idiomatic Rust patterns. Each implementation emphasizes clarity, type safety, and ownership semantics while maintaining performance characteristics expected from these structures.

## Implemented Data Structures

### Trees
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)** - Generic binary tree with ordered insertion, search, deletion, and tree traversals
- **AVL Tree** _(in progress)_ - Self-balancing binary search tree
- **B-Tree** _(in progress)_ - Multi-way search tree optimized for disk access
